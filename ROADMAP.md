Plans for development:
1. Implement host system (almost done, just need graph)
2. Implement files and filesystem
3. Implement FTP
4. Implement NPC system
5. Implement privilege system
6. Implement map (how it will actually work in 3d space)
7. Implement weapons and damage system
8. Implement NPC hosts
9. Implement file minigames
10. Implement random events
11. Implement quest system

They do not strictly have to be done in order.

Anything else likely can be implemented alongside one of the tasks above as it's simpler (e.g. bitcoin system).

After all of the above has been done, likely taking a couple of months, we look at the other networks.

Anything relating to how something will look should be ideally done last.

## Host System
Pretty much the only thing left to do is to implement the graph and the methods for it.
