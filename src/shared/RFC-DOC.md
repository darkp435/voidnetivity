## Abstract
Request for comments (RFCs) are formal documents published by the Networks Development Task Force. RFCs adhere to a strict structure to make it more navigable and professional. This document describes the common sections and conventions used in RFCs.
## Status of this memo
This document is available to the public for referral. There are no risks in owning this document or referring to it externally.
## Publication notes
This document has been published from the host "ndtf-misc", containing the original copy and all preserved versions of it for historical and review purposes. This document is mutable and the content is subject to change without warning or notice.
## Understanding Sections
The sections of an RFC varies greatly by RFC, but they all **must** include the sections described below:
### "Abstract" section
An abstract is a concise summary of the RFC for quick and easy general information on the protocol, such as the RFCs purpose and what content will be in the RFC.
*!!! We almost never remove the abstract for this purpose.*
### "Status of this memo" section
The "status of this memo" section provides notes on the confidentiality and status on the document.
### "Publication notes" section
The "publication notes" section provides information on where the document was published and the location of the copies stored. This is primarily for people who wish to contribute to reviewing or creating RFCs.
### "Implementation" section
The "implementation" section provides detailed information for developers on the recommended or standard way to implement the protocol. This section may be omitted if the purpose of the RFC was to provide general information (i.e. RFCs that do not describe protocols).
*!!! The implementation section is usually removed due to it being very heavy and useless to most hackers.*
### "Security considerations" section
The "security considerations" section provides security insights, notices, and warnings of the protocol. This section may be omitted if the purpose of the RFC was to provide general information (i.e. RFCs that do not describe protocols).
*!!! This section usually provides hints to us.*
### "Request for comments" section
The "request for comments" section provides information on the process of commenting on that specific RFC and contact and user information of the authors and reviewers. It is useful to those that wish to contribute to existing RFCs.
*!!! We usually remove this section.*
### "Acknowledgements" section
The "acknowledgements" section are to acknowledge contributors to the RFC.
*!!! We usually remove this section.*
